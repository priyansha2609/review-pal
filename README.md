# review-pal

The vocabularies of "helpful" reviews are very similar to those of the others(ones that are explicitly marked as 
unhelpful and the ones not voted for).
It would have been better if the initial training data would have un-helpful explicitly marked and 
all helpful ones marked correctly.
In this model we also see that there might not be a relation between length of the review and the helpfulnes of the reviews.

and there is no correlation between "helpfulness" and the length or positivity of a review. 
There are probably other factors influencing readers' decision to rate a review as helpful, such as where a review appears in the list of reviews, or what sort of product was reviewed.

That said, a model that can predict whether a review will be "helpful" with even a small amount of accuracy can be used to 
score the reviews and accordingly give points to the user.
This allows us to alot badges to the users which are shown on UI and help the buyers to make informed decision.
